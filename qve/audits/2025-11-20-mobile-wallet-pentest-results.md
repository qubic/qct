# Mobile Wallet Penetration Test Results

The penetration test for the mobile wallet funded under [this proposal](https://github.com/qubic/proposal/blob/main/CCF-Funding-Requests/2025_08-09-mobile-wallets-pentest.md) is completed.

## Financials
The proposal requested QUBIC calculated at a rate of 2'200 USD per billion to cover 15'840 USD.

At the time of payment, the market rate was higher. The settlement was executed through an OTC trade at 3'100 USD per billion.

Total spent: 5'109'677'420 QUBIC.

Remaining balance: 2'090'322'580 QUBIC.

The remaining balance is returned to the CCF fund ([see transaction](https://explorer.qubic.org/network/tx/kxenicaacrxmgeqnaycyqqcmykkfvbqhpywiusjzfesujfjzhmjxmnyemyva)).

## Reports
The penetration test was conducted by Kudelski Security between August 18-26, 2025 (Android and iOS). A retest was performed on November 5 and November 11, 2025.

>A confidential version with additional technical details is available upon request following NDA execution.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
The findings were low risk and related to hardening improvements. Both Android and iOS show a solid security posture with no significant vulnerabilities. Sensitive data is protected through platform-level encryption features.  
We will address the remaining low-critical issues according to priorities and resource capacity.  
The ongoing development work does not introduce high-impact security changes, so no additional reviews are planned for the mobile wallet at this stage.
