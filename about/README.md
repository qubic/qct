## The History
During the first STECO period (oct23-apr24) QCT was operated as a tech department which is able to deliver the Qubic core technology including the needed tools to work with Qubic.
This includes the Qubic core (https://github.com/Qubic/core) but also tools around needed to grow Qubic (CLI, wallet, explorer, archive, RPC/API and some libraries). The tech team was also heavily involved in integrations for exchanges or wallets.


This organisation was to bootsrap all the needed tech to the users. While all those software was needed to ramp up Qubic and to enable the community to interact with Qubic easily. It was a classical organization how one would know it from companies.

To promote the spirit of decentralization the existing centralized STECO organization was disolved and at that place Workgroups were established.

One of those workgroups is `Qubic Core Technology` (QCT). This document shall describe what QCT is about.
