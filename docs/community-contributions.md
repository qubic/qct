# Contributor Ruleset and Paid Contribution Process

>[!NOTE] 
> THIS IS THE DRAFT DOCUMENT AND MAY CHANGE


## 1. Scope
QCT can declare tasks as designated **community** and **paid** tasks. Any contributor may work according to the rules on such tasks.

Unsolicited or uncoordinated pull requests will not be reviewed or paid.

---

## 2. General Rules
- Only tasks published in the [Community Board](https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/30) project are eligible.
- You need to use your **main** Github account.
- Announce intent to work on an issue before starting by commenting on it.
- Wait for confirmation or assignment from a QCT maintainer. 
- Follow repository code style and maintain compatibility with the defined build environment.
- Include sufficient inline documentation and tests for new functionality.

---

## 3. AI Usage
If AI-assisted tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini) are used at any point:
- Declare this in the pull request under **“AI Assistance Disclosure.”**
- Describe what was AI-generated or AI-aided.
- The contributor remains fully responsible for correctness, license compliance, and originality.

---

## 4. Paid Task Types

### 4.1 Fixed Bounty Tasks
- The issue already defines a fixed **payment amount**.
- This **payment amount** is defined in Qubic.
- First qualified contributor to claim and be assigned may begin work.  
- 50% payment occurs after review and merge (accepted pull request), under the stated conditions.
- 50% payment occurs after deployment/publish.

### 4.2 Quote-Based Tasks
For open-ended or complex issues:
1. The issue is labeled **“Open for Quote.”**
2. Contributors may submit a **quote** by commenting:
   - Proposed **price** (fixed).
   - **Estimated completion time.**  
   - Short **technical approach** outline.
3. QCT maintainer review and select one quote.
4. Once accepted, the terms are recorded in the issue comment thread and locked.
5. Contributor proceeds according to the agreed scope.

---

## 5. Development Rules
- Work in a separate **fork** or **branch**.
- Reference the issue number in all commits and pull requests.
- Ensure code builds cleanly and passes all tests.
- Add new tests when adding or modifying functionality.
- Avoid third-party code unless compatible with the repository license and explicitly allowed (needs previous approval from QCT maintainers).

---

## 6. Review and Acceptance
- QCT maintainers verify technical accuracy, adherence to requirements, and documentation.
- Requested changes must be implemented before merge.
- A merged pull request marks the task as **Completed**.

---

## 7. Payment Procedure
- Payment occurs **only after merge and validation**.
- Contributor submits required payout details (wallet address).
- Future eligibility can be revoked for repeated non-compliance or low-quality work.

---

## 8. Disputes
- If a contributor disputes a review or payment outcome, they may request **secondary review** by another maintainer or review group.
- The secondary review decision is final for that issue.

---

## 9. Legal
- All contributions fall under the repository license.
- Submissions must be original and free of legal or contractual restrictions.
- Payment does not constitute employment or a continuing contract.
