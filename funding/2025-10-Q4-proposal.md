> Option 1: yes, 646 billion QUBIC


## How We Used Past Funding

- With the [previous funding proposal](https://github.com/qubic/qct/blob/e1ac5c9e7e39fa4a9660b42366b8d0e5b5fb17e0/funding/2025-04-Q2-proposal.md), QCT received 288 billion QUBIC from CCF. </br>This amount, initially estimated to cover QCT operations from April 2025 to June 2025, ended up fully funding until Octubre 2025. The reason higher period of funding was a) Qubic price fluctuation and b) less expenses as expected. (Refer to the [financial reports](https://github.com/qubic/qct/blob/main/financial-reports/README.md) for details)

- Core and Integration teams work in bi-weekly iterations. Reports detailing the achievements of each team per iteration can be found [here](https://github.com/qubic/qct/blob/main/iterations/iteration-log.md).

- Monthly financial reports can be found [here](../financial-reports).

## Overview

We are requesting **646 billion QUBIC** to support the continued development of the Qubic Core.

Taking into account current development needs and potential market fluctuations, the requested funding aims to cover development costs equivalent to **840k\$** over the next **6 months**. (~140k\$/month)

The Qubic amount was calculated using a valuation of **1300 USD per billion**.

The requested funding will be allocated to:
- Pay team salaries
- Cover service and server expenses necessary for QCT operations (e.g. RPC/API/Archive infra)
- Cover the costs to run several test nets
- Cover [Community Contributions](../docs/community-contributions.md)

Our development team is working on critical improvements and features essential for the long-term success of Qubic.
Ensuring financial stability allows us to focus on innovation, security, and scalability without disruption.

## Success Indicators
- Qubic network is in a stable state.
- Bugs are fixed in an appropriate time.
- Core and Integration boards are always updated so any member of the Qubic community can see who is working on what. The boards are public and can be found here: [Core](https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/1) and [Integration](https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/21/views/1)
- At least once a month, someone from the Qubic Core Team informs the community on the progress (organizing/participating in AMAs/Presentation, written announcements).
- Technical updates are shared regularly in the Qubic Discord server.
- The developers are available to answer community questions and support ecosystem developers during onboarding. They actively engage with the community and stakeholders through the following public channels: [core-ama](https://discord.com/channels/1243503949013717063/1267841365425786881) and [integration-ama](https://discord.com/channels/1243503949013717063/1278229593647484939).
- Every repository maintained by the Qubic Core Team includes a clear description and a manual on how to clone, compile, and run the project.

## Cost Break Down
Each month costs:
- ~5000$ for Infrastructure, including servers, test environments, and other non-personnel operational expenses. (effective costs are documented [in the financial reports](https://github.com/qubic/qct/tree/main/financial-reports))
- ~91K$ for team salaries. More details about paid/unpaid team members, visit [here](https://github.com/qubic/qct/tree/main/org-reports).

>[!NOTE] 
> - Current team members are engaged through various arrangements: some are employed via different companies, others are independent contractors or volunteers.</br>
> - Team members may work full-time or be compensated on an hourly basis.</br>
> - Salaries are paid either in USD or QUBIC, depending on individual agreements.</br>

### Changes to previous budget request

The infrastructure costs are higher because:
- It now includes a production ready test net.
- The operational costs have increased (e.g. more server load; anti ddos protection)

The salary costs are higher because:
- Costs of client/frontend team is included
- Costs for partial aigarth participation is included (the core dev's will help in aigarth development where needed)

The auditing layer is open for volunteer to join.

## Governance
- Any unspent funds (e.g., due to an increase in QUBIC’s market value) will either be used to cover expenses for the next quarter or returned to the CCF in the event of QCT’s dissolution.
- @j0et0m will receive the funds upon approval of the proposal and will be responsible for reporting all expenditures.
- To ensure transparency and proper management of CCF funds, the Qubic Core Technology team will grant an independent community team access to all relevant documentation, including salary details, service invoices, and transaction history.
