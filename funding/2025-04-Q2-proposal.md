## How We Used Past Funding

- With the [previous funding proposal](https://github.com/qubic/proposal/blob/b4de3432f4ee6c9b77b0b551badbd8debefcfaeb/CCF-Funding-Requests/2024-11-14-tech-funding.md) approved in the Epoch 135, QCT received 180 billion QUBIC from CCF. </br>This amount, initially estimated to cover QCT operations from November 2024 to January 2025, ended up fully funding February 2025 as well, and covering 74.35% of the expenses for March 2025.

- Core and Integration teams work in bi-weekly iterations. Reports detailing the achievements of each team per iteration can be found [here](https://github.com/qubic/qct/blob/main/iterations/iteration-log.md).

- Monthly financial reports can be found [here](https://github.com/qubic/qct/tree/financial-2025/financial-reports).

- The [Financial Audit Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZQynlU8j0ujhj8hBrvkH19eFCT7JloSUPbZMjwPaY) gives a cross reference from an external view.

- The main achievements of QCT with the past funding were:
  - Established a clear operating of the Teams including regular reporting.
  - On boarded developers for integration and core teams and extended the testing team.
  - A stable Qubic Core Network (main net).
  - Active support for computor operators, bug fixing and enhencements for the core software.
  - Active participation at the Qubic Roadmap.

## Overview

We are requesting 288 billion QUBIC to support the continued development of the Qubic Core.
Taking into account current development needs and potential market fluctuations, the requested funding aims to cover development costs equivalent to 288K USDT over the next three months.
The Qubic amount was calculated using a valuation of 1000 USDT per billion.

The requested funding will be allocated to:
- Settle outstanding payments for March 2025.
- Pay team salaries for Q2 2025 (April–June).
- Cover service and server expenses necessary for QCT operations during Q2 2025 (April–June).

Our development team is working on critical improvements and features essential for the long-term success of Qubic.
Ensuring financial stability allows us to focus on innovation, security, and scalability without disruption.

## Success Indicators
- Qubic network is in a stable state.
- Bugs are fixed in an appropriate time.
- Core and Integration boards are always updated so any member of the Qubic community can see who is working on what. The boards are public and can be found here: [Core](https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/1) and [Integration](https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/21/views/1)
- At least once a month, someone from the Qubic Core Team informs the community on the progress (organizing/participating in AMAs/Presentation, written announcements).
- Technical updates are shared regularly in the Qubic Discord server.
- The developers are available to answer community questions and support ecosystem developers during onboarding. They actively engage with the community and stakeholders through the following public channels: [core-ama](https://discord.com/channels/1243503949013717063/1267841365425786881) and [integration-ama](https://discord.com/channels/1243503949013717063/1278229593647484939).
- The developers also collaborate with the marketing team via marketing-tech (private) Discord channel.
- Every repository maintained by the Qubic Core Team includes a clear description and a manual on how to clone, compile, and run the project.
- QCT roadmap commitments are consistently updated and remain on track.

## Cost Break Down
Each month costs:
- ~5000$ for Infrastructure, including servers, test environments, and other non-personnel operational expenses.
- ~91K$ for team salaries. More details about paid/unpaid team members, visit [here](https://github.com/qubic/qct/tree/financial-2025/org-reports).

>[!NOTE] 
> - Current team members are engaged through various arrangements: some are employed via different companies, others are independent contractors or volunteers.</br>
> - Team members may work full-time or be compensated on an hourly basis.</br>
> - Salaries are paid either in USD or QUBIC, depending on individual agreements.</br>

## Governance
- Any unspent funds (e.g., due to an increase in QUBIC’s market value) will either be used to cover expenses for the next quarter or returned to the CCF in the event of QCT’s dissolution.
- @j0et0m will receive the funds upon approval of the proposal and will be responsible for reporting all expenditures.
- To ensure transparency and proper management of CCF funds, the Qubic Core Technology team will grant QCB and/or an independent community team access to all relevant documentation, including salary details, service invoices, and transaction history.
- For the previous period, we had @MichaelStar as the only member of this auditing layer and he expressed that can continue on this role. He will recruit a second person which will support him.
