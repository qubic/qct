## People

## Topic
How can we optimize the QCT trasury?

The Basics:
- most employees have their salary in value of USD
- until now, the payoments in qubic were done once a month with a three day average price
  
The Goal:
- Soften volatility by distributing purchases over every day
- Most employees already receive USDT/C (and want to keep it that way)
- Build up a treasury in case the Qubic price drops significantly

## Decision
We think that with the current trade volume selling regularly a small portion of Qubics will not impact the price negatively.

Therefore, starting with May 2025. QCT will do the following:
1. From the Qubics in the treasury, 14 billion are converted into USDT per week.
2. The conversion will be done on Gate.io using the TWAP algorithm â€” meaning 2 billion would be sold every 24 hours.
3. The USDT are held in a public wallet.

Employee payouts in USDT/C continue as before in Qubic (as long as the current price is above the average purchase price); if the price drops, the already converted USDT will be used.

To document everything, we will add another reporting about the current USDC/T treasury.

## Discussion
Ther were other options discussed like Call or Put Options to further optimize everything. Using bulk sales via OTC. Those options have to be elaborated more in detail. To have a simple model to start with, the decision was taken.
